//! Open a decayfmt file: corrupt it in place on disk, then display it.
//!
//! This module owns the entire open flow and all of its file I/O. The order of
//! operations is fixed and must not be reordered: x is parsed from the filename, the
//! file is confirmed writable, the payload is corrupted, the corrupted bytes are
//! written back to disk, and only then is the result displayed. Corruption is written
//! before display, so a crash mid-flow cannot produce an uncorrupted read. The whole
//! read-modify-write sequence runs under an exclusive advisory lock on the file, so
//! overlapping opens each cost their own corruption instead of overwriting each other.
