//! Corruption algorithms for image and text payloads.

//! These are pure functions over byte slices. There is no file I/O and no CLI
//! logic here; the caller is responsible for reading the payload, calling into
//! this module, and writing the result back. The invariant this module upholds is
//! that corruption is always stochastic and always drawn from a cryptographically
//! secure generator seeded from operating system entropy, never from a fixed seed.
//! It is never deterministic, because a reproducible corruption sequence could be
//! replayed to reconstruct the original and undo the decay. Large payloads are
//! processed in parallel regions, each of which seeds its own OS-entropy
//! generator; the per-byte decisions stay independent across region boundaries,
//! so the aggregate remains undirected noise.

// `chunks_exact_to_as_chunks` (a newer clippy lint) suggests `slice::as_chunks`, which is
// stable only from Rust 1.88; we keep `chunks_exact` to preserve a low minimum supported
// Rust version. `unknown_lints` is allowed too so older clippy versions that predate this
// lint do not warn about the allow itself.
